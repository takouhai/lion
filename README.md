# lion
A theme for Tumblr, influenced by Steven Universe.


##What lion does

 - Provide your tumblr blog with a large, pink fluffy lion-based theme
 - Support most/all post types
 - Support mobile devices and almost all viewports
 - Use Bootstrap 3.3.5 to make your blog schnazzy and up to date
   - it's what all of the cool kids are using these days, right?
 - Load quickly
   - Since it uses a CDN to load CSS classes, lion loads super fast and allows GIFs to load faster than ever
 
## What lion doesn't 

 - Support (easy) custom theming
 - Support anything else really
 - Actually give you a pink fluffy lion :(


If you want to see lion get more attention and grow more, please let me know by filing an [issue](https://github.com/thattacoguy/lion/issues) to let me know what's broken/what I can improve.
